## How can you succede in IT Automation?

There are many habits that can help you transition from manual IT operation to IT
Automation:

Define a simple and testable objective/outcome
: Arguably the most important of the pre-requisites. It cannot be stressed
  enough that the outcome of an automated process needs to be defined and
  testable so that you have a clear way to determine if the automated procedure
  has been succesful.

Encourage open involvement of all the stakeholders
: Inputs and perspectives from all stakeholders is extremely important to
  undestand the impact and all the ramification to the automated changes your
  procedure is going to apply.

Prepare a fallback plan
: Despite the amount of efforts and no matter how thorough your testing is,
  things can go south pretty fast and pretty badly; that's where you need
  to have a fallback plan, restore the previous state and start over.

Choose the best practices and principles, over the tools
: There is an abundance of technology that can help you achieve your
  objectives, and we encourage you to have a look around and make your own
  judgement. However, tools are subject to a high pace of change and evolution,
  they often are trend driven, or just volatile. A solid understanding of the
  best principles of IT design and operation will take you much further than
  any tool; they will give you a more stable base for the decision you're going
  to take, and help you stay away from vendor's lock-in.

Start your continuous improvement journey
: Make an honest assessment of the amount of time, energy and resources spent
  in each area of your IT, find a small, simple objective whose automation would
  prove beneficial for those involved in it. Start your journey.
