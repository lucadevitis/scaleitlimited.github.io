## Why would you use IT Automation?

**IT automation** replaces time-consuming tasks and allows IT staff to keep up with
the increasing scale and complexity of IT operation and infrastructure.
**IT automation** allows teams to operate modern infrastructure environments,
wether they are on premise, in the cloud or hybrid, and manage the performance,
scale, usage peaks and uptime of the most complex services.

The potential applications of automation are nearly infinite, but some of the
most common ones include:

- Cloud automation
- Resource provisioning
- Infrastructure Configuration
- Network management
- Security automation (such as monitoring and response)

**IT Automation** has several concrete benefits:

Cost savings
: With **IT automation**, fewer labor hours are required to complete routine
	tasks.  Automation can also increase productivity, reduce infrastructure
	costs by optimizing resource utilization, and decrease costs associated with
	human error.

Time savings
: By automating the most repetitive and time-consuming tasks, IT staff free up
	their time to spend on higher-level tasks.

Faster operations
: **IT automation** can speed up data center and cloud operations considerably,
	reducing service and resource delivery times from weeks to hours.

Reduced errors
: Automation ensures consistency on a large scale, something thatâ€™s impossible
	to do with individuals completing tasks manually. 

Better security
: Automated processes require fewer humans to view and safeguard sensitive
	information, which reduces the possibility of breaches. Additionally, **IT
	automation** can be used to help IT teams keep up with an incident response.
