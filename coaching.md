## How is Coaching with us?

Our coaching starts from the position of believing that people have the ability to
address and resolve their own issues if they can approach them in the right
mental state. The success of our coaching comes form putting the
coachee in charge of their own improvements, encourage a positive attitude, and
keep them focused. Let us highlight some of the properties of performance
coaching with us:

The coachee is always in charge
: This is a staple caracteristic of any of our coaching session; the coach
  provides no input, but rather helps the coachees to find their own way, at
  their own pace.

Adult to Adult conversations
: Our coaching is a strictly non-directive relationship. We believe that
  coachees can reach their objectives on their own, and enjoy the empowering
  feeling that comes with the fact that they don't have to share the credits
  with enybody other then temselves. We pledge to keep a positive attitude,
  encourage the development of new perspectives and maintain a strictly
  non-judgemental line of questioning.

Coaching conversation are structured
: Our coaching sessions follow a specific structure that is designed to allow
  the coachee to clearly identify and overcome all the biases that hinder their
  progress. Here is the general process:
  1. Review the previous session and the actions that have been comepleted.
  2. Set the goal to discuss for the current session.
  3. Consider where the coachees are at the present moment with their goal.
  4. Consider the coachees options in meeting their goal.
  5. Agree on some actions.
  6. Summarise the session before completing the session.

Confidential
: Although the coaching relationship is not considered legally confidential
  (like for the medical and legal profession), we bind ourselves to the
  coaching code of ethics; this guarantees the confidentiality of each session
  and any information pertaining the coachee.

Total dedication
: We conduct our sessions from an calm and relaxed environment without any form
  of distraction; each session lasts an average of 30 minutes and we want to
  spend all that time to maximize your chances of success.

Remember all your progresses
: We encourage all the coachees to bring pen and paper to each session an take
  notes, but we know that something may slip through. This is why we record
  each session and make it available to our coachees.
