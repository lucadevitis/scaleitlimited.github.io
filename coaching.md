synopsis: >-
  Coaching is both a personal and professional service. It creates a partnership
  (defined as an alliance, not a legal business partnership) between a Coach and
  a Coachee in a thought-provoking and creative process that aims to inspire the
  Coachee to maximize personal and professional potential. We build a
  relationship that is designed to facilitate the creation/development of
  personal, professional or business goals and to develop and carry out a
  strategy/plan for achieving those goals.
