Synopsis
: {{ page.synopsis }}

Intended audience
: We intend to reach for Managers and Leaders who have team members working
  either on-premises or remotely and need to have a check-in conversation.

Intended purpose
: We intend to help you have a structured and meaningful check-in conversation
  with a team member. In line with our values and priorities, our objectives
  are:
  - To show care for the human beings and their well-being
  - To encourage positive mindset and lifestyle
  - To offer a feeling of safety
  - To openly discuss about objectives, tasks, obstacles, and improvement

Tips
: - Take some time before the Check-In to prepare yourself. For example, try to
    get in the best mood possible, go through your notes.
  - Find a quite place, switch off any unnecessary tool, avoid any possible
    distraction. If you are doing a remote Check-In, try to have a neutral
    background.
  - Appreciate the benefits of your silence. While stimulating positive mindset
    with open questions, it is important to let the team members to have some
    time to think about their answers.
  - Try to be patient, don't rush your questions, give yourself some time to
    think about what you've just heard, and your next question.

Caveats
: - The conversation is meant to have a natural flow and that's why the
    following sections have a specific order.
  - The questions in each section are only suggestions. We encourage you to
    prepare your conversation in advance and adapt your questions to the person
    and the situation you will be facing.
  - It's unreasonable to ask anybody to like everybody else; however, building a
    better relationship with your team members is coachable habit that you can
    benefit from.
  - If you'd rather avoid to have the conversation resulting from any of the
    following questions, you could find some benefit from confidence coaching.

## Reflections

Let's start with the team member's well-being. Here are some example questions:

How are you doing?
: Not just a pleasantry, but an honest questions to gauge the general state
  (potentially, even physical/mental health) of the team member.

What kind of challenges are you facing?
: This question should encourage the team member to open up. We would encourage
  you not to skip a question like this; on the other hand we would also
  encourage you to to refrain to get involved, give any solution or advice and,
  instead, offer coaching or the support of a coach.

How are you handling them (challenges)?
: A follow-up question that is meant to encourage a positive mindset. This
  question can be molded around some of the team member's strengths as to
  suggest that they have weapons in their arsenal.

If you could find more confidence/clarity, how would that help you to handle them (challenges)?
: The purpose of this question is to understand if your team member could
  benefit from coaching; the support of a coach could help them to
  build up the strength to go through difficult times.

What opportunities and positives are you seeing? 
: Another question with the purpose of encouraging a positive mindset, even in
  troubled times.

What are you doing to keep yourself fit and healthy?
: Mental health and physical health go hand in hand.

## Home and Family
In this section we move the conversation to the social well-being (either with
family or friends). Here are some example questions:

How are things with family and friends?
: Again, not just a pleasantry.

How are you feeling about the balance between your home life and work life?
: The ability to balance time/resources/energies between home life and work
  life is cause of distress for many people.

If you could have more time/resources/energy, how would that help you in the relationship with your family/friends?
: The purpose of this question is to, again, understand if coaching could bring
  some benefits to the team member's quality of life.

## Team
In this section we start to transition to work related topics starting with the
communication with the team and the organization. Communication is a
cornerstone of an effective team.

How are you staying connected with the organization?
: Let's see if the team member is considering all the communication options to
  stay effectively connected the organization.

How are you getting on with the team?
: The purpose of this question is to pick up possible frictions between members
  or remote communication issues.

What can we do to enable a more effective communication between you and your team members or the organization at large?
: This question can help to get feedback on the various communication options,
  get suggestions and new options, as well as picking up on other forms of
  communication problems.

## Work and Objectives

questions, which should be self explanatory:

  - What kind of obstacle have you faced?
  - How could we have avoided or mitigated that obstacle?
