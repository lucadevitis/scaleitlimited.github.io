title: IT Performance
synopsis: >-
  **IT performance improvement** is a key strategic process, as well as a
  multi-faceted, complex management activity that combines information
  gathering, monitoring achievements, feedback and discussions. It has a
  **Human side**, an **Operation side**, and a **Business side**; after all,
  teams of people build the systems that run the business. Effectively setting
  and tracing your **IT Performance** metrics will allow you to get the best
  possible picture of your **IT performance**; how will you drive the
  improvement is the real question.

## Performance appraisals do not drive better performance

Appraisals were popular into the early 2000s as flat organisational structures
become more widespread. Supervisors often had up to 25 direct reports to manage
(compared to an average of 6 in the 1960s), as well as having to deliver their
own work. Having regular, developmental performance discussions was simply not
feasible in many organisations.

Fast forward to today and the business landscape is fundamentally different. We
no longer have high inflation levels and flat management structures have
generally fallen out of favour. Businesses are faster moving and set strategic
objectives. Many businesses have come to the conclusion that assessing staff
performance once or twice a year no longer makes sense.

One of the key reasons why appraisals do not drive for better performance, is
that they are past-focused, instead of future-focused. They were mostly
considered a scrutiny of the employee activity during the period of time, to
establish if they proved to be as performant as predicted. They lacked a proper
conversation about the employee strenghts and how they could have been leveraged
for the benefit of the company.
